# Week 2 — VSDBabySoC:Step into Real Chip Design

---

This isn’t just another academic exercise. VSDBabySoC is a **hands-on playground** to learn how real chips are built—from CPU to analog output—using open-source tools and actual silicon-ready flows.

## 🤔 What *Exactly* Is an SoC?

An **SoC (System-on-Chip)** is a full computer squeezed onto a single piece of silicon.  
No separate CPU board. No external memory controller. No extra sound card.  
**Everything lives together on one die.**

Think of your phone:  
📱 It runs apps, plays music, connects to Wi-Fi, and lasts all day on a tiny battery.  
That’s only possible because it uses an SoC—not a bunch of loose chips.

### Why SoCs Rule:
- 🔋 **Low power**: Shorter wires = less energy wasted  
- 📏 **Tiny footprint**: Fits in wearables, sensors, even medical implants  
- ⚡ **Fast**: No waiting for signals to cross board traces  
- 💰 **Cheaper**: One chip > ten chips + PCB + assembly

## 🔧 What’s Inside a Typical SoC?

Every SoC has four key pieces:

### 1. **CPU** → The brain  
In BabySoC: **RVMYTH**, a minimal RISC-V core. No fancy pipelines—just enough to run real code.

### 2. **Memory** → Short-term and long-term storage  
BabySoC keeps it simple: external RAM/ROM. We’re focused on **integration**, not memory controllers.

### 3. **Peripherals (I/O)** → The chip’s senses  
BabySoC includes:
- 🕒 **PLL**: Cleans up the clock so the CPU doesn’t glitch
- 📡 **10-bit DAC**: Turns digital numbers into analog voltage (for audio, video, sensors)
- 🔌 **SPI**: Lets you load code or debug

### 4. **Interconnect** → The nervous system  
A bus (like Wishbone or AXI) that lets CPU talk to DAC, PLL, etc.  
In BabySoC: a simple point-to-point wiring—no fancy NoC needed.

## 🎓 Why BabySoC? (And Why It’s Perfect for Learning)

Let’s be real: commercial SoCs are **huge**, **complex**, and **closed-source**.  
You can’t see how the GPU talks to the memory controller in a Snapdragon.

**BabySoC is different:**  
✅ Only **3 blocks**: CPU + PLL + DAC  
✅ **Fully open-source**—read, modify, break, fix  
✅ Built to **teach fundamentals**, not ship to customers

### How it actually works:
1. You power it on → crystal oscillator starts ticking  
2. **PLL** locks onto that signal and outputs a clean, stable clock  
3. **RVMYTH** boots up and runs your code  
4. Your program writes values to register `r17`  
5. **DAC** reads `r17` and outputs a matching analog voltage → `OUT`  
6. Plug `OUT` into a speaker or TV → hear/see your code in action! 🎶📺

Signal flow: crystal → PLL → CPU → DAC → analog output*

### What you’ll actually learn:
- How clock domains affect timing  
- Why you can’t just feed CPU output directly to analog pins  
- How to verify a full system—not just a single module  
- The pain (and joy) of integrating IP blocks that weren’t made to work together

## 🧪 Why Functional Modeling Comes *Before* RTL

Here’s a hard truth: **writing RTL too early is a waste of time.**

Before you touch Verilog:
1. **Model the system in C/Python**  
   → Simulate the DAC output when `r17 = 512`  
   → Check if the PLL locks in 10 µs or 100 µs  
2. **Run your firmware on the model**  
   → Does your sine-wave generator actually produce a sine wave?  
3. **Tweak the architecture**  
   → Need 12-bit DAC instead of 10-bit? Change it now—not after 2 weeks of RTL

This is how real teams work.  
You don’t start coding until you’ve **proven the idea works** at a high level.

### Where it fits:
```
Spec → 🧠 Functional Model → ✍️ RTL → ⚙️ Synthesis → 🗺️ P&R → 🖨️ GDSII → 🖥️ Silicon
```

In BabySoC, your functional model answers:  
❓ *“If the CPU writes 0x200 to r17, what voltage comes out of the DAC?”*  
Get that right *before* you write a single line of Verilog.

## 💡 Bottom Line

VSDBabySoC isn’t about building the next iPhone chip.  
It’s about **learning the right way** to design silicon:  
- Start simple  
- Verify early  
- Integrate step by step  
- Trust **simulation**, but prove it with **GLS**  

And yes—you’ll end up with a real chip that outputs real analog signals.  
That’s the magic. 🔮
